## Signatures and Merkle Trees | The deep dive to understand it

- Merkle proofs comes from the merkle trees
- Merkle trees is a data structure
- Merkle proofs verify that that data exists in merkle trees and comes from it
- Each of the leap represent a data, and is mostly referred to leap node
- Data is hashed via keccak to produce leap node -> leap nodes are hashed to produce intermediate nodes -> then intermediate nodes are hashed to produces root hash
